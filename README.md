# Code Maker & Breaker

This program is a tool where a user can enter in a word or phrase and then click a button to have it be coded into a string of numbers. In return you can now enter in those numbers into another field and have the number converted back to the original word. It's a secret message decorder like spies used to use on black and white television.
